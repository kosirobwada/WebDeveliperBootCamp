    <p>
        Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <a href="now">xxx</a> molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class
        Cephalopoda which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy.

        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in
        mass.[2]

    <h2>Range and Habitat</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike other cephalopods, cuttlefish possess a unique internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous
        and is made of aragonite. The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the
        gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle.[15] Each species' cuttlebone has a
        distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of
        the features that distinguish them from their squid relatives.[16]
